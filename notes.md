Put any notes for us here:
I enjoyed the assessment! I found it more fun than challenging. This is my first time working with React so I went as far as I could in the time allotted. I did however purposefully neglect completing the final step and focused my remaining time on code refactoring and UX/UI instead. I took the assessment in chunks and logged a few steps specifically. Note: I didn't leave any comments in my code, as I aim for my code to explain itself.
